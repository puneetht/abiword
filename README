This is intended to be a ruby wrapper for abiword.
It only works on 64 bit linux, because thats where I 
a) Need it to run on that platform
b) I didn't have time to compile abiword on mac. 

Right now all it does is convert doc and docx files to pdf format.

Its very simple to use

require 'abiword'

Abiword::Abiword.doc2pdf("docfile.doc")

It creates a file called docfile.pdf in the same directory as docfile doc
